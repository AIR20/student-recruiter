Will we live in a world dominated by machines? Could we ever create a conscious machine?

They cover an ever expanding spectrum of topics. A few of the more unlikely applications are justifying intertribal warfare, the benefits of cannibalism, how the leopard gets its spots, how sex determination in crocodiles has let them survive and demonstrating the connection between badgers and bovine tuberculosis. This lecture shall describe the modelling of two applications.\n\nThe prognosis for patients with high grade brain tumours is grim and the various treatment protocols such as surgery, radiation and chemotherapy cannot effect a cure. A simple model using patient data and brain scans quantifies the spatio-temporal growth of brain tumours. Analysis of the model shows how difficult it is to decide on the tumour volume to be treated and shows why such treatments have so little success. The model simulations can estimate life expectancy for the patient and show how it might be possible to use a patient\'s past record to quantify possible treatment efficacy.\n\nThe rise in divorce rates in developed countries is a widespread but poorly understood phenomenon. A simple but surprisingly predictive mathematical model, based on only a few parameters describing specific marital interaction patterns, has helped design new scientifically-based intervention strategies for troubled marriages which are proving encouragingly successful in clinical practice. In a 12-year longitudinal study on a large number of marriages, the model has predicted divorce with an accuracy of 94%.','Public lecture','mathematics',2,'2015-05-13 18:00:00','2015-05-13 19:00:00','2015-04-27 14:00:00',7,NULL,NULL,'pending',0,NULL);

It took over 350 years for anyone to provide a proof for Fermat‚Äôs Last Theorem, considered by many as the most notorious problem in the history of mathematics, and no one has yet offered a proof for the Riemann Hypothesis, first proposed in 1859. These mysteries have become an obsession to some people, who have devoted years of their lives trying to understand them. But why do we bother? What is the significance of overcoming these challenges? Join our panel of mathematicians as they reveal the fascinating stories behind these mathematical endeavours and discuss why it is so important that we remain curious about finding solutions.\n\nDr June Barrow-Green is a Senior Lecturer in the History of Maths in the Mathematics and Statistics department at The Open University.

"There is a delightful synergy between software development and magic. Both require an understanding of human behaviour as well as mathematics."\n\nBoth software design and magic utilise logic, creativity and the knowledge of human attention and memory to successfully work. The principle of ‚Äòmisdirection\' in magic is also important in user-centred software. Software and self-working tricks utilise algorithms, and both are verified using logical proof to ensure the software or trick works. The research team has developed an interactive magic show to demonstrate the link between magic and computer science research. The team presents the trick, challenges the audience to work it out, and then explains how it is performed and demonstrates how this relates to computer science.\n\n"Watching magic tricks, and learning how to do them, not only entertains but utilises important aspects of software design," says Peter.','Exhibition','computer science',2,'2015-05-20 18:00:00','2015-05-20 19:00:00','2015-04-30 14:00:00',5,NULL,NULL,'pending',0,NULL);
